The website uses the Phalcon php framework, these are the full instructions for developing
1. install bitnami wampstack, or xampp (or any other php & mysql distribution)
2. download the correct Phalcon dll for your environment from https://phalconphp.com/en/download/windows 
	Note: If installing on Linux, follow the instructions at https://phalconphp.com/en/download
	
3. Add the dll download into the php folder of your web stack, in php/ext
4. In the file php/php.ini, add the line 

		extension=php_phalcon.dll
		
	Immediately above the module settings (they start like this)
	
	extension=php_phalcon.dll
	;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
	; Module Settings ;
	;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
	
5. Restart your webserver

6. clone the git repository into the htdocs folder of your webserver
   
   Its should end up at htdocs/ScotchCreekCottagesManagerSite
   
7. Take the example.htaccess_example file, rename it as ".htaccess" and place it in 
   the root directory of your webserver (Note that if your webserver will be handling multiple sites,
   you will need to alter the .htaccess file and place it in htdocs/ScotchCreekCottagesManagerSite instead)
   
8. The site should be up and running now! you can test this by navigating to localhost (add the correct port if your server isn't on 80)

9.To begin developing with eclipse, follow the remaining steps

10. If you don't have it, get the php eclipse download or plugin

11. Create a new php project, the name doesn't matter
12. Delete the project, without deleting the contents on disk
13. Copy/Paste the contents of the project folder into htdocs/ScotchCreekCottagesManagerSite
14. Use the eclipse "Import Project" feature to add the web application as a project
